# Deploy a Custom AMM Using a Factory

_This section is for developers looking to deploy a custom pool contract that has already been written. If you are looking to design a custom AMM with a novel invariant, start [here](/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html)._

Balancer recommends that custom pools be deployed via a factory contract because our off-chain infrastructure uses the factory address as a means to identify the type of pool, which is important for integration into the UI, SDK, and external aggregators.

To fully set up a new custom pool so that normal liquidity operations and swaps are enabled, five required steps must be taken:

1. Deploy a factory contract that inherits from [BasePoolFactory.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/BasePoolFactory.sol)
2. Deploy the pool contract using the factory's `_create` function
3. Register the pool using the factory's `_registerPoolWithVault` function
4. Use [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2) to approve the Router to spend the tokens that will be used to initialize the pool
5. Call [`router.initialize()`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/e9bd6b0b154f2bd083a5049267b7a417c5a2c984/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IRouter.sol#L39-L56) to seed the pool with initial liquidity

## Creating a Custom Pool Factory Contract

A factory contract should inherit the [BasePoolFactory.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/BasePoolFactory.sol) abstract contract, which sets the table for deploying pools with `CREATE3` and streamlines the registration process.

Below, we present an example custom pool factory that uses the `ConstantSumPool` contract from [Build your custom AMM](/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html#build-your-custom-amm)

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab ConstantSumPool

```solidity
contract ConstantSumFactory is BasePoolFactory {
    // Each factory can only deploy one type of custom pool
    constructor(
        IVault vault,
        uint32 pauseWindowDuration
    ) BasePoolFactory(vault, pauseWindowDuration, type(ConstantSumPool).creationCode) {}

    // Streamline the process of deploying and registering a pool
    function create(
        string memory name,
        string memory symbol,
        bytes32 salt,
        TokenConfig[] memory tokens,
        uint256 swapFeePercentage,
        bool protocolFeeExempt,
        PoolRoleAccounts memory roleAccounts,
        address poolHooksContract,
        LiquidityManagement memory liquidityManagement
    ) external returns (address pool) {
        // Deploy a new pool
        pool = _create(abi.encode(getVault(), name, symbol), salt);
        // Register the pool
        _registerPoolWithVault(
            pool,
            tokens,
            swapFeePercentage,
            protocolFeeExempt,
            roleAccounts,
            poolHooksContract,
            liquidityManagement
        );
    }
}
```

### Factory Constructor Parameters

- `IVault vault`: The address of the Balancer vault
- `uint32 pauseWindowDuration`: The period, starting from deployment of a factory, during which pools can be paused and unpaused, see [FactoryWidePauseWindow.sol](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/main/pkg/solidity-utils/contracts/helpers/FactoryWidePauseWindow.sol)
- `bytes memory creationCode`: The creation bytecode of the pool contract used by `CREATE3` for deployment

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab BasePoolFactory

```solidity
    constructor(
        IVault vault,
        uint32 pauseWindowDuration,
        bytes memory creationCode
    ) SingletonAuthentication(vault) FactoryWidePauseWindow(pauseWindowDuration) {
        _creationCode = creationCode;
    }
```

:::

### Pool Deployment Parameters

- `bytes memory constructorArgs`: The abi encoded constructor args for the custom pool
- `bytes32 salt`: Used to compute a unique, deterministic address for each pool deployment

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab BasePoolFactory

```solidity
    function _create(bytes memory constructorArgs, bytes32 salt) internal returns (address pool) {
        pool = CREATE3.deploy(_computeFinalSalt(salt), abi.encodePacked(_creationCode, constructorArgs), 0);

        _registerPoolWithFactory(pool);
    }
```

:::

### Pool Registration Parameters

- `TokenConfig[] memory tokens`: An array of descriptors for the tokens the pool will manage, see [Token Types](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/vault/token-types.html)
- `uint256 swapFeePercentage`: Fee charged for each swap. For more information, see [Swap fees](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/vault/swap-fee.html)
- `bool protocolFeeExempt`: If true, the pool's initial aggregate fees will be set to 0
- `PoolRoleAccounts memory roleAccounts`: Addresses allowed to change certain pool settings, see [Pool Role Permissions](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/core-concepts/pool-role-accounts.html)
- `address poolHooksContract`: Contract that implements the hooks for the pool. If no hooks, use the zero address
- `LiquidityManagement memory liquidityManagement`: Specifies support for [Custom Liquidity Operations](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/build-a-custom-amm/build-an-amm/create-custom-amm-with-novel-invariant.html#add-remove-liquidity)

::: code-tabs#shell
@tab BasePoolFactory

```solidity
    function _registerPoolWithVault(
        address pool,
        TokenConfig[] memory tokens,
        uint256 swapFeePercentage,
        bool protocolFeeExempt,
        PoolRoleAccounts memory roleAccounts,
        address poolHooksContract,
        LiquidityManagement memory liquidityManagement
    ) internal {
        getVault().registerPool(
            pool,
            tokens,
            swapFeePercentage,
            getNewPoolPauseWindowEndTime(),
            protocolFeeExempt,
            roleAccounts,
            poolHooksContract,
            liquidityManagement
        );
    }
```

::: info
Although deploying pools via a factory contract is the recommended approach, it is not mandatory since it is possible to call [`vault.registerPool`](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/developer-reference/contracts/vault-api.html#registerpool) directly.
:::

## Initializing a Custom Pool

After a custom pool has been deployed and registered, the next step is to add initial liquidity to the pool, which is a three step process:

1. Ensure the [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2) contract has been granted sufficient allowance to spend tokens on behalf of the `msg.sender`
2. Transfer sufficient allowance to the [Router](https://docs-v3.balancer.fi/concepts/router/overview.html) with [`Permit2.approve`](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/cc56ad0f3439c502c246fc5cfcc3db92bb8b7219/src/AllowanceTransfer.sol#L25-L30)
3. Call [`router.initialize()`](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v3-monorepo/blob/e9bd6b0b154f2bd083a5049267b7a417c5a2c984/pkg/interfaces/contracts/vault/IRouter.sol#L39-L56)

After a pool has been initialized, normal liquidity operations and swaps are instantly enabled.

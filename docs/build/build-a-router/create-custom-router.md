# Create a custom Router

A custom Router is a smart contract which interacts with the Balancer Vault and utilizes the Vaults function in unique combinations. The deployment of a custom Router is beneficial for various projects in the DeFi space. To name some verticals this could be: 

- DEX aggregators, which want to tweak the default interaction via the Balancer Router in a certain way to deliver best prices to their users.
- DeFi projects wanting to provide seamless liquidity migrations of their users from various Dexes to Balancer in order to participate from the deep liquidity offered on Balancer
- DeFi projects looking to provide liquidity on Balancer in custom proportions across multiple pools with more granular control metrics as part of the liquidity provisioning
- DeFi projects looking to enhance the liquidity mining experience for LPs by introducing a better staking & migration flow.

The main work custom routers in the outlined examples above have in common is that:
- They utilize multiple Vault interactions based on the required use-case
- They add additional control flows & external interactions to the Router smart contract for granular liquidity operations

## Usage

The following custom Router displays how LPs can migrate pool liquidity to a new pool with the same tokens & stake it in a gauge without the need to transfer tokens except the BPT.

# Build on Balancer

AMMs built on the Balancer protocol benefit from the security of the Balancer vault. This enables developers to utilize
the well-developed Balancer AMM ecosystem, while the vault's optimized architecture streamlines the development process
and allows teams to concentrate on their product.

We assist teams throughout this process, leveraging our extensive experience in bringing innovative AMMs to market.
This includes addressing finer details such as aggregator integration, which is vital for any new AMM to capture the
necessary organic flow to compete effectively.

Our aim is to simplify the development process and facilitate the creation of novel AMMs with minimal friction.

When building on Balancer, there are three paths to explore:
